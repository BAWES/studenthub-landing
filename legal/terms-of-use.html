        <h6>Responsibility for User-Generated Content Posted on or Through this Site</h6>
        <p><em>You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post.</em> </p>
        <p>Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any UGC. This means that you, not StudentHub, are entirely responsible for all UGC that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the UGC you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permission to post it.</p>
        <p>Because we do not control the UGC posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that UGC. You also agree and understand that by accessing this Site, you may encounter UGC that you may consider to be objectionable. We have no responsibility for any UGC, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein. We are not liable for any loss or damage of any kind you may claim was incurred as a result of the use of any UGC posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through this Site. The UGC posted on or through this Site expresses the personal opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not necessarily reflect the views of StudentHub or any person or entity associated with it.</p>
        <h6>You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it. </h6>
        <p>You own the copyright in any original UGC you post. We do not claim any copyrights in UGC.
