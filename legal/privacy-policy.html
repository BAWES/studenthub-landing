Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, this Privacy and Cookies Policy is designed to describe:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Who we are and how to contact us</li>
          <li>Your rights relating to your Personal Data</li>

        <p>This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy is intended to meet our duties of transparency under the “General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”.</p>
        <p>We will post any modifications or changes to this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy on this page.</p>
        <h6>Who We Are and How to Contact Us</h6>
        <p>Who we are. BAWES is the Controller (for the purposes of the GDPR) of your Personal Data (referred to as either “StudentHub”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy).</p>
        <p>How to contact us. If you have any questions about our practices or this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy, please contact us at .</p>
        <h6>Your Rights Relating To Your Personal Data</h6>
        <p>You have the right under this Privacy and Cookies Policy, and by law if you are within the EU, to:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Request access to your Personal Data. If you are within the EU, this enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
          <li>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
          <li>Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right if you are within the EU to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
          <li>Object to processing of your Personal Data. This right exists where we are relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing of your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
          <li>Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
          <li>Request the transfer of your Personal Data. If you are within the EU, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
          <li>Withdraw consent. This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data (“Consent Withdrawal”). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the certain specific functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to exercise your rights. </strong>If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using the contact details in Who We Are and How to Contact Us.</p>
        <p>Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
        <h6>Complaints</h6>
        <p>‍<br>If you would like to submit a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Data, please contact us at: contact@studenthub.co with the subject: ’Data Privacy Inquiry’.<br>We will reply to your complaint as soon as we can.</p>
        <h6>Marketing Communications Preferences</h6>

          <li>by contacting us at any time using the contact details in Who We Are and How to Contact Us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to Personal Data provided to us as a result of emails relating to existing or pending hires, using the Services or consent to direct marketing communications.</p>
        <h6>What Personal Data we collect</h6>
        <p>StudentHub uses Personal Data we collect to provide the Services, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, analyze how the Services are used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track user content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.</p>

        <h6>How We Use Your Personal Data and Why</h6>
        <p>We generally use Personal Data for the following: to deliver and improve our Services; to manage your account and provide you with customer support; to perform research and analysis about your use of the Services; to develop, display, and track Content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Services and other sites, including, potentially, providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites; website or mobile application analytics; to diagnose or fix technology problems; to automatically update the Services on your device; to verify your identify and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; to enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Service;</p>
        <p>In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a legal basis for that use if you are within the EU. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your Personal Data only where:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>
          <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; or</li>
          <li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also rely on your consent as a legal basis for using your Personal Data where we have expressly sought it for a specific purpose. If we do rely on your consent to a use of your Personal Data, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place). We have set out below, in a table format, more detailed examples of relevant purposes for which we may use your Personal Data.</p>
        <p>Purpose</p>
        <p>Why do we do this</p>
        <p>Providing, updating, and maintaining our Services, Site, applications and business</p>
        <p>To deliver the Services you have requested, including, for example, registering you as a user, managing your account and profile, and authenticating you when you log in.<br>this also includes, for example, surfacing relevant jobs, including you in candidate search results, and effectively matching your skillset and interests with available jobs on the Site.</p>
        <p>Processing payments</p>
        <p>To process payment for subscriptions on our Site, to protect against or identify possible money-laundering or other fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.</p>
        <p>Research and development</p>
        <p>To enable us to improve the Services and better understand our users and the markets in which we operate. For example, we may conduct or facilitate research and use learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, areas for additional features and improvement of the Services and other insights. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before introducing the feature to all users.</p>
        <p>Communicating with users about the Services</p>
        <p>To send communications via email and within the Services, including, for example, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, product updates, security alerts, and administrative, billing and account management related messages. We may also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, we may provide you with updates regarding hiring and recruiting related matters, and providing information regarding your investments through the Site. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases, you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.</p>
        <p>Providing customer support</p>
        <p>To resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, comments and questions, to analyze crash information, to repair and improve the Services and provide other customer support.</p>
        <p>Enhancing security</p>
        <p>To keep our website, our applications, our Services and associated systems operational and secure, including, for example, verifying accounts and activity, monitoring and investigating suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of our terms and policies.</p>
        <p>Marketing, promoting and driving engagement with the Services and third-party products and services</p>
        <p>To send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including, for example, by email and by displaying products, job listing, candidates, events, promotions and other information on our Site and applications or other companies’ websites. These communications may be aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services or promoting third-party products and services. You generally can control whether you receive these communications as described in this policy under Marketing Communications Preferences.</p>
        <p>To comply with applicable law, legal process and regulations and protect legitimate business interests</p>
        <p>As we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, order, subpoena, rule of a self-regulatory organization or audit or to protect the safety of any person, to address fraud, security or technical issues, or to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, such as, for example, in connection with with the acquisition, merger or sale of securities or a business (e.g. due diligence).</p>
        <p><strong>What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data? </strong>Where we need to process your Personal Data either to comply with law, or to perform the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with the functionalities of the Services). In this case, we may have to stop you using our Services.</p>
        <h6>How We Use Cookies And Other Tracking Or Profiling Technologies</h6>
        <p>StudentHub may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your usage of the Services, including the pages and articles and presentations you viewed, time spent using certain features of the website, demographic data such as server locations, connection speed, and other information that does not identify you. Like most online services, we also use cookies, log files, clear GIFs, tracking pixels, web beacons, and other technologies that may collect Personal Data.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h6>Cookies:</h6>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>What are cookies? </strong>When you visit the Services, we may send one or more “cookies” – small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let StudentHub help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Services to us so we can provide you with a more personalized experience, but does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.</p>
        <p><strong>What cookies do we use?</strong> Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
        <h6>Type of cookie</h6>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <h6><em>Essential Cookies</em></h6>
        <p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and help the content of the pages you request to load quickly. Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>
        <h6><em>Functionality Cookies</em></h6>
        <p>These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Site.</p>
        <h6><em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em></h6>
        <p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered via these cookies does not “directly” identify any individual visitor. However, it may render such visitors “indirectly identifiable”. This is because the information collected is typically linked to a pseudonymous identifier associated with the device you use to access our Site. The information collected is aggregated and anonymous. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site. We use a number of different tools including Google Analytics, Segment, Amplitude, Intercom, and Fullstory for this purpose.</p>
        <h6><em>Targeted and advertising cookies</em></h6>
        <p>These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. Third party advertisers may also use other technologies in addition to cookies placed on the Site (such as JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
        <h6><em>Social Media Cookies</em></h6>
